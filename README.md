## Getting Started (ง •̀ω•́)ง✧

First, run the loopback server:

```bash
npm start
```
(loopback server defaults to localhost:3000 so in this code I changed it to 4000)

Next run the react server via:

```bash
npm start
``` 

in a new terminal.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

I've put the insert statements to insert dummy data into the table in [/medmanager/src/app/dummy_data.md](/medmanager/src/app/dummy_data.md).
