## Getting Started (ง •̀ω•́)ง✧

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

pnpm dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
